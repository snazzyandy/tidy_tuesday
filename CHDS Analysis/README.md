# What factors impact school shooting outcomes? 
Testing data from https://www.chds.us/ssdb/data-map/ to look at what factors impact school shooting outcomes.

Bit morbid...but might lead to some interesting convos

## Description from the original data:

Center for Homeland Defense and Security
K-12 School Shooting Database
Raw data downloaded from: www.chds.us/ssdb

The K-12 School Shooting Database documents when a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week.

This is a public resource available for use for any purposes. Use of this information does not require written or verbal permission from the Center for Homeland Defense and Security. Use of this data should be cited with a link to www.chds.us/ssdb and/or this citation:

### Sheet Details:
The information is structured as a relational database with a unique incident ID number that links the "incident", "shooter", "victim", and "weapon" tabs.

**Incident Tab**: Incident ID number and the details of what, where, and when the shooting happened.

**Shooter Tab**: Incident ID number and details about the shooter. Multiple rows have the same incident ID number if there were multiple shooters.

**Victim Tab**: Incident ID number and details about the victim. Multiple rows have the same incident ID number if there were multiple victims.

**Weapon Tab**: Incident ID number and details about the weapon used (including weapons that were possessed by the shooter during the incident but were not fired). Multiple rows have the same incident ID number if there were multiple weapons used.
