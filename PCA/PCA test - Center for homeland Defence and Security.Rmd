## Description of data: What are we looking at?
Today a friend of mine sent me an interesting website. 

[Dashboard of School Shooting incidents]()
https://www.chds.us/ssdb/data-map/


```{r setup, include=TRUE}
#Read the raw data i've pulled from the site 
shooter <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snazzyandy/tidy_tuesday/main/PCA/Shooter%20Table.csv')
incident <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snazzyandy/tidy_tuesday/main/PCA/Incident%20Table.csv')
victim  <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snazzyandy/tidy_tuesday/main/PCA/Victim%20Table.csv')
weapon  <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snazzyandy/tidy_tuesday/main/PCA/Weapon%20Table.csv')
